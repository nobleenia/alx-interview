    Generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth level.

    Pascal's Triangle is constructed such that each number
    is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
    The function returns a list of lists,
    where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of levels in the triangle.
    If n is less than or equal to 0,
    the function returns an empty list.

    Returns:
    list: A list of lists, with each inner list containing integers
    representing a row of Pascal's Triangle.
