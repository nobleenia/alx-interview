# Island Perimeter

This project contains a function `island_perimeter(grid)` which calculates the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid. 

## Usage

To use the function, import it and pass a grid as an argument:

```python
from 0-island_perimeter import island_perimeter

grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output: 12
